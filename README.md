# Ho Nguyen Gia Linh - Data Analyst Portfolio
## About
Hi, I'm Linh! I’m a final-year Business Administration student specializing in Data Analysis and Accounting & Finance, with a deep interest in using data to drive strategic decision-making and improve business performance. With a strong foundation in analytics and hands-on experience from academic projects and competitions, I’m eager to start my career as a Financial Data Analyst or Data Specialist.

Throughout my journey, I’ve applied tools like SQL, Python, Power BI, Excel, and SAS to conduct meaningful analysis—from predicting customer churn to visualizing performance KPIs for business growth. My background combines both the technical side of data analytics and the financial understanding of business operations, allowing me to interpret complex datasets and translate them into actionable insights.

Beyond the classroom, I’ve worked as a Research Assistant, supported business case competitions, and led communication campaigns using data to improve audience engagement. I’m constantly exploring new tools and sharpening my skills, driven by curiosity and a passion for uncovering patterns that inform smarter decisions. Whether working independently or collaborating in a cross-functional team, I’m motivated by the challenge of transforming data into impactful outcomes.

## Portfolio Projects
In this section I will list data analytics projects briefly describing the technology stack used to solve cases.

### Analyzing the Factors Contributing to the Success of a Movie
**Code:** [`Analyzing the Factors Contributing to the Success of a Movie.ipynb`](https://github.com/tiannaparris/PortfolioProjects/blob/main/Analyzing%20the%20Factors%20Contributing%20to%20the%20Success%20of%20a%20Movie.ipynb)

**Goal:** To determine what factors contribute the most to a movie's success.

**Description:** The project focused on analyzing a dataset of movies released between 1980 and 2022. The dataset included movie titles, ratings, genres, release dates, budgets, gross earnings, and other relevant information. The project involved loading the data, cleaning and preprocessing it, performing exploratory data analysis (EDA), analyzing the correlation between budget and gross earnings, and implemented Pearson’s correlation statistical analysis.

**Skills:** data cleaning, data analysis, correlation matrices, hypothesis testing, data visualization.

**Technology:** Python, Pandas, Numpy, Seaborn, Matplotlib, SciPy.

**Results:** Using Python functions the analysis revealed that votes and budget have the highest correlation with gross earnings, while the company has no significant correlation.

### Tech Store Sales Analysis

**Goal:** To examine the sales history of the store and extract insights on its performance, as well as to identify potential improvements that can be implemented.

**Code:** [`Tech Store Sales Analysis.ipynb`](https://github.com/tiannaparris/PortfolioProjects/blob/main/Tech%20Store%20Sales%20Analysis.ipynb)

**Description:** The dataset contains a list of sales records.  The records include the products for sale and order information(order id, order date, price, quantity ordered and purchase address). The project includes the following steps: data loading, data cleaning and preprocessing, EDA (exploratory data analysis), analyzing sales data and hypothesis testing.

**Skills:** data cleaning, data analysis, hypothesis testing, data visualization.

**Technology:** Python, Pandas, Matplotlib.

**Results:** Python functions that calculated and visually presented the sales data by month, city, and the most commonly sold items. Additionally, the reasons for the high frequency of these items being sold were analyzed and provided as insights.



### Nashville Housing Data Cleaning
**Code:** [`Data Cleaning Project Queries: Nashville Housing.sql`](https://github.com/tiannaparris/PortfolioProjects/blob/main/Data%20Cleaning%20Project%20Queries:%20Nashville%20Housing.sql)

**Description:** The dataset contains a list of houses that have been sold in Nashville between 2013 and 2019. This project includes the following steps: data loading, data cleaning and preprocessing.
